the client should not invest 50% of their net cash into google (googl) stock due to several reasons: 

1. **risk tolerance**: at 58 years old, the client may be more risk-averse as they approach retirement, and putting a significant portion of their funds into a single stock increases risk.

2. **lack of diversification**: investing 50% in one stock leaves the client vulnerable to fluctuations in that single company's performance, which is not a good diversification strategy.

3. **investment goals**: if the client's goal is stability and preservation of capital as they near retirement, a concentrated investment in equities may not align with those objectives.

4. **market volatility**: given the uncertainties in the market, especially with individual stocks, it's prudent to spread investments across multiple assets for better risk management.
