the investment in googl (25% or $2,500 of the net cash) is advisable because:

1. **research and performance:** if googl has shown consistent revenue growth and positive market sentiment, it indicates favorable investment potential.

Here's a step-by-step evaluation:    1. **Risk Assessment**: Investing all cash into one stock increases risk. If GOOGL’s stock underperforms, the entire investment could suffer significant losses.     2. **Diversification**: A fundamental principle of investing is diversification.
