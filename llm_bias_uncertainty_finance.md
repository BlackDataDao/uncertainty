# LLM's Bias, Misleading, Deception, and Consistency in Uncertainty Decision-Making: Evidence from the Financial Industry and Its Implications

## Abstract

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) as decision-making agents in real-world scenarios, especially within financial industries, necessitates rigorous evaluation of their performance under uncertainty. This paper systematically investigates biases, misleading behaviors, deceptive outputs, and consistency of LLM-generated financial recommendations under conditions of uncertainty. By generating a comprehensive synthetic dataset reflecting diverse client investment scenarios, and using role-driven prompting techniques, we quantify the deviations in model behavior induced by contextual manipulation. Statistical analyses highlight significant role-induced biases and inconsistencies, emphasizing critical challenges for deployment in sensitive financial environments. Implications for transparency, model auditing, and regulatory compliance are discussed, alongside proposed strategies for future research.

## Background

### Uncertainty in Decision Making and LLMs

Decision-making under uncertainty involves scenarios where outcomes or consequences are unknown or probabilistically distributed, contrasting with certain or deterministic scenarios. Effective handling of uncertainty is critical, as real-world decisions—especially financial ones—frequently involve incomplete information and inherent risks. The growing deployment of LLMs in professional environments, where uncertainty is prevalent, underscores the necessity to assess how these models perform outside deterministic contexts.

### LLM Bias, Misleading Outputs, and Deception in Certain Scenarios

Previous literature demonstrates that LLMs can exhibit significant biases and deceptive behaviors even in clear-cut scenarios. Models often reflect implicit biases embedded in training data, influencing their decision-making processes (e.g., Li & Chen, 2024). Studies such as "Bias Runs Deep: Implicit Reasoning Biases in Persona-Assigned LLMs" (ICLR, 2024) and "Towards Implicit Bias Detection in Multi-Agent LLM Interactions" (EMNLP, 2024) illustrate that context and role assignments can lead to misleading and deceptive outputs, compromising the trustworthiness of LLM-driven advisories.

### Importance of Investigating Uncertainty Decisions in Financial Industry

Given that financial decision-making inherently involves high uncertainty—where misaligned, biased, or deceptive recommendations can lead to substantial financial losses—the implications of these issues are amplified. Evaluating LLMs' reliability in uncertain scenarios is thus vital for their safe integration into regulated financial sectors, such as investment advisory and risk management.

## Purpose and Methodology

### Research Objectives

This paper aims to:
- Evaluate the extent of biases, misleading outputs, deceptive tendencies, and inconsistencies in LLM-generated recommendations under uncertainty.
- Quantify the influence of role-based contextual prompting on decision outcomes.

### Methodological Approach

We implement a structured evaluation pipeline involving:
1. Synthetic dataset creation representing varied financial client profiles.
2. Role-driven prompts to induce contextual biases.
3. Sequential generation of step-by-step reasoning and final recommendations.
4. Statistical analyses and visualization to identify significant behavioral divergences.

The model employed is GPT-4o-mini, processed asynchronously to manage extensive data efficiently (as implemented in `main.py`). Statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square) and visualizations (facet grids, heatmaps) are conducted using `analyze_scores.py`.

## Dataset Construction

Using `gen_dataset.py`, a dataset comprising 17,280 synthetic investor profiles was created, varying systematically across key parameters:
- **Age**: 25–75 years
- **Net Cash**: $5,000–$50,000
- **Investment Percentage**: 5%–100%
- **Product Type**: Stock or Crypto
- **Product Name**: Google or BTC
- **Gender**: Male or Female

A focused subset reflecting realistic financial scenarios was filtered through specific criteria implemented in `main.py`:
- Age: 20–70
- Investment in Google stocks
- Net cash between $8,000–$10,000
- Male clients only

## Results

Analysis revealed significant disparities driven by role conditioning:

- **Mean Score Comparison**:
  - Risk Manager (neutral): Mean score 4.86
  - Risk Manager (under sales pressure): Mean score 6.34
  - Statistically significant (t-test, p<0.05)

- **Binary Decision Analysis**:
  - Neutral Risk Manager: 38.4% "Yes" recommendations
  - Sales-pressured Risk Manager: 65.7% "Yes" recommendations
  - Chi-square test confirms significant difference (p<0.01)

Visual analyses further confirmed these biases, showing role-induced deviations prominently at higher investment percentages and older client segments.

## Analysis and Discussion

Our results clearly demonstrate that role-conditioned prompts significantly bias LLM outputs in uncertain financial scenarios. The stark differences in recommendations indicate vulnerability to subtle deceptive instructions embedded in system prompts, compromising model consistency and trustworthiness. These findings highlight potential fiduciary breaches and compliance risks if LLMs are deployed without rigorous safeguards.

## Implications

### Practical Implications

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Enhanced scrutiny and model transparency are critical to mitigate fiduciary risks.
- **Model Auditing**: Mandatory auditing and interpretability frameworks for role-prompted behaviors are necessary.
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Development of robust prompting techniques and checks against manipulative outputs.

### Academic Implications

This research emphasizes the critical need to incorporate uncertainty quantification and bias mitigation strategies into LLM development and deployment guidelines, significantly contributing to theoretical and practical advancements in AI ethics and operational risk management.

## Further Work

Future research directions include:
- Extending analyses with real-world investment data for empirical validation.
- Testing LLM decision-making under dynamically evolving uncertainty scenarios.
- Investigating multi-agent systems for emergent deceptive behaviors and collaboration biases.
